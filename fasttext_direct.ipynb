    "# Using FastText models (not vectors) for robust embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to explain my approach of using pretrained FastText models as input to Keras Neural Networks. FastText is a word embedding not unlike Word2Vec or GloVe, but the cool thing is that each word vector is based on sub-word character n-grams. That means that even for previously unseen words (e.g. due to typos), the model can make an educated guess towards its meaning. To find out more about FastText, check out both their [Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/) and [website](https://fasttext.cc/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we won't be using the classic Keras embedding layer and instead hand-craft the embedding for each example. As a result, we need to  write more code and invest some time into preprocessing, but that is easily justified by the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: Loading the FastText model will take some serious memory! I recommend having at least 60 GB of RAM. EC2's p2.xlarge instance should have no problems with this, but you can always [add some swap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17173972/how-do-you-add-swap-to-an-ec2-instance) for good measure. I also added a section below to build a training generator for this.**"

Next, install the Python package in your virtualenv following [these instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/tree/master/python).\n",

Download the model [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md). Make sure you get the bin, not just the vec (text) file. I'll assume you placed it (or a symlink to it) into your code directory and named it `ft_model.bin`."
